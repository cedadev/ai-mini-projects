| 2024 | Deep Neural Networks | [Notebooks](https://github.com/stfc-sciml/sciml-workshop/tree/master/course_3.0/DNN) | Hybrid | STFC SciML Team | 2.5 hrs | CEDA Staff (09/07/2024) | Intro to Neural Networks and there features and capabilities; included some hands-on Jupyter Notebooks for trying these approaches for ourselves | Useful introduction - can review and work on materials ourselves |
| 2024 | AI4EO Workshop | [Workshop website](https://ml4eo.org/) | In-person | University of Exeter | 2 days | Ag Stephens (24-25/06/2024) | Excellent workshop. Lots of interesting talks showing how people are using AI in different EO applications. Most of it focussed on image classification and segmentation of 2D high or low-res Earth imagery. |   |
| 2024 | Classical Machine Learning | [Notebooks](https://github.com/stfc-sciml/sciml-workshop/tree/master/course_3.0/CLASSICAL) | Hybrid | STFC SciML Team | 2.5 hrs | CEDA Staff (07/06/2024) | Intro to Supervised and Unsupervised ML; Including Decision Trees and Clustering; Slides and Jupyter Notebooks using `scikit-learn`. |  |
| 2024 | LLMs, RAG, Fine-Tuning - Outerbounds workshop | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/outerbounds/generative-ai-summit-austin-2023) | Online | Outerbounds (company that maintains Metaflow) | 3 hrs | Ag Stephens (29/05/2024) | Interesting example of running ML workflows in the cloud; Metaflow, AWS, Argo; Overview of using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs. | Useful example to see how industry does these things. RAG might be interesting to us. |
| 2024 |Introduction to Geospatial Data Analysis with ChatGPT and Google Earth Engine | [Webpage](https://wlc.unu.edu/courses/course-v1:UNU-INWEH+INWEH-20+2023_T4/course/) | Online | United Nations University  - Institute for Water, Environment and Health | 1/2 day | Ag Stephens (13/03/2024) | Interesting combination of ChatGPT prompting and coding in Google Earth Engine. | It is likely that this area will continue to grow in importance in our sector. |
| 2024 | Introduction to Machine Learning for Earth Observation | [Webpage](https://www.nceo.ac.uk/training/introduction-to-machine-learning-for-earth-observation/) | Online | NEODASS Team (PML/NCEO) | 1 day | Ag Stephens (03/2024) | Entirely self-led course introducing some basic ML approaches using `scikit-learn`; then extends to EO imagery examples using classification approaches; runs on NEODASS GPU system using notebooks. | Nice intro and overview, short videos included inside the notebooks to guide you along. |
| 2024 | NVIDIA Accelerated Computing with CUDA and Python | [Overview page](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/training/instructor-led-workshops/fundamentals-of-accelerated-computing-with-cuda-python/) | Online | NVIDIA Trainers | 1 day | Ag Stephens (24/01/2024) | Overview of GPU vs CPU computing; Introduction and example uses of CUDA ; Some gotchas and computation/data structures and optimisation. | Good overview, with Notebook examples to refer back to. |
