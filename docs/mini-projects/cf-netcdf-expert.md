# CF-NetCDF Expert mini-project

## Justification

- **Objective:** Train a Large Language Model (LLM) on a large dataset of _high-quality_ CF-NetCDF file headers. Also, tune the LLM with documentation about the CF-Conventions, NetCDF format, CF standard names and (python) tools to work with them. Explore whether the LLM can take on the role of a "CF-NetCDF Expert" to advise data providers, managers and end-users.
- **Success Metrics:** Can the "Expert" advise on how to create, improve, correct and validate CF-NetCDF files. Conference and/or journal submissions would be valid outcomes.

## Project Outline

- **Project Name:** CF-NetCDF Expert
- **Scope:** Exploratory work to be undertaken in collaboration with national and international partners.
- **Timeline:** 
  - Planning: 2 day
  - Development: 15 days
  - Testing: 5 days
  - Deployment: 5 days
- **Team:** 
  - Developer: CEDA Team, SciML Team, NCAS?
  - Project Lead: Ag
  - Tester: ?
- **Datasets:**
  - This project depends on creating a large dataset of CF-NetCDF Headers that can be used by Machine Learning models.
    - See: https://github.com/cedadev/ai-mini-projects/tree/main/docs/mini-projects/cf-netcdf-training-dset.md
- **AI Methods:**
  - Possible approaches include:
    - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
    - Training of LLM
    - Fine-tuning of LLM
- **Dependencies and tools:**
  - Possible tools:
    - Open source LLM (e.g. Llama3)
    - Commercial LLM (e.g. ChatGPT)
- **Metrics:**
  - Human testing
  - Comparing the results of the Expert with the CF-Checker results
