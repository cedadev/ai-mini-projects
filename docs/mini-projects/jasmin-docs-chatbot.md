# JASMIN Docs Chatbot mini-project

## Justification

- **Objective:** Create a chatbot that knows about JASMIN based on our documentation. Deploy the chatbot for internal testing and evaluation.
- **Success Metrics:** Does the chatbot tell the truth? Does it add value? Could we consider providing a public version? Could we add more information to it (for CEDA docs etc)?

## Project Outline

**Project Name:** JASMIN Docs Chatbot
