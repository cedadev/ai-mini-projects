This parent experiment is an extension of piControl except historical transitions of land use are applied from 1700-1860 in order to allow the terrestrial carbon stores to respond to the imposition of land use and produce realistic fluxes by the start of the historical run in 1861. Several forcing agents varied during the 145 year duration of the ESM2G-C2_all_historical_HC2 experiment in a manner based upon observations and reconstructions for the late 19th and 20th centuries. The aerosol concentrations were computed by an off-line model. The time varying forcing agents include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, halons), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, aerosol concentrations (sulfate, black and organic carbon, sea salt, dust), volcanic aerosols, solar irradiance and land use transitions. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.",
