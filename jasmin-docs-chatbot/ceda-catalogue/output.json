The radar complements the MST radar located near Abersywyth, providing greater vertical coverage than the other wind profiling radars in the Met Office's UK \"Operational Upper Air Network.\" Operating at 64 Mhz, the South Uist 64 Mhz radar runs typically sounds from 1 to 13 km with a heigh resolution of either 150 or 400m, depending on the mode of operation. The site is located at 57.353 N, 7.375 W and at a height of 4 m above mean sea-level and has a WMO id of 03019. It had a beam angle of 15.0 degrees and is operated with an averaging period of 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains vertical wind profiles from the 64MHz wind profiler located at Camborne.", "keywords": "Met Office, wind", "time": ["2004-05-30T23:00:00", "2012-05-10T23:59:59"], "bbox": {"east": -7.375, "north": 57.353, "west": -7.375, "south": 57.353}, "phenomena": ["Wind Direction"], "projects": ["Met Office Wind Profiler data (1998-onwards)"], "url": "https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/3ca88ef5aca50e29b257ffaff3a047ab/"}]
