# Can we build an LLM tool for checking the consistency of our docs?

## Experiment 1

Just put the entire JASMIN Help Docs into the context and prompt an LLM to 
check the consistency.

## Experiment 2

Attempt to build a Knowledge Graph from the Docs, and get it to check the 
consistency when building that, or once it has been built.
