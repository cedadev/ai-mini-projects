      "\n",
      "1) Internal summary of key information\n",
      "\n",
      "About the site and support\n",
      "- Docs use richer formatting; navigation via top nav, breadcrumbs, sidebar, ToC, tags, and inter-article links.\n",
      "- Report doc site problems via the GitHub issues link; each page shows last updated date and commit details.\n",
      "- For other issues/questions, use the JASMIN Help beacon “Ask” contact form (bottom-right).\n",
      "\n",
      "Account types\n",
      "- Standard account: one human user only; manages SSH key/password/roles via Accounts Portal; key must be unique and traceable; can be a responsible user for shared/service accounts; training accounts are short-term standard accounts preset for events.\n",
      "- Shared account: used by a small, defined set of responsible users (each uses own SSH key); shared account itself has no SSH key; responsible users’ keys are synced; may set a password (to be shared securely); can apply for roles and act like a standard account; requests reviewed/approved by JASMIN.\n",
      "- Service account: used by a service/function only; has responsible users; cannot log into the portal or set passwords; no SSH key; roles granted by arrangement; requests reviewed/approved by JASMIN; notifications go to responsible users (optional service email).\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting started / login\n",
      "- Steps to access JASMIN:\n",
      "  1) Generate SSH key on local machine.\n",
      "  2) Create a JASMIN Accounts Portal profile and upload public key.\n",
      "  3) Request the “jasmin-login” service (creates system account).\n",
      "  4) Log in using SSH with agent-forwarding (-A).\n",
      "  5–7) Optional: request additional services (e.g., Group Workspaces), get CEDA account if needed, and link JASMIN-CEDA accounts.\n",
      "- Use sci servers for development/light interactive tasks; LOTUS for batch/heavy compute; xfer servers for data transfer; NX for graphical desktop within JASMIN.\n",
      "- Present SSH key either by specifying -i each time or loading into ssh-agent (recommended). Methods covered for Windows (OpenSSH and MobaXterm), Mac (Keychain), and Linux.\n",
      "\n",
      "Storage overview and usage\n",
      "- Home directories: /home/users/<username>, SSD, 100 GB quota, backed up via snapshots (self-service restore, ~1–2 weeks).\n",
      "- Group Workspaces (GWS): main place to write/share project data; storage types include PFS (/gws/pw/j07) and SOF (/gws/nopw/j04). Most GWS are not backed up (except snapshot backups on /gws/smf SSD volumes).\n",
      "- Scratch: /work/scratch-pw2, /work/scratch-pw3 (PFS, fast, parallel-write), and /work/scratch-nopw (SSD, fast for small files, no parallel-write). Intended for temporary/intermediate data; auto-cleaned if not accessed for 28 days. Create subdirectories under scratch for your username.\n",
      "- /tmp: local on physical sci and LOTUS nodes only; OK for small, node-local temporary files; do not rely on /tmp on virtual sci (not local).\n",
      "- CEDA Archive: mounted read-only at /badc, /neodc, etc. Licensing varies; ensure permissions and linked accounts as needed.\n",
      "- Symlinks advice: avoid symlinks in home directories to other volumes (can overload metadata servers and hang ls). Prefer environment variable path substitutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Backups and snapshot recovery\n",
      "- Home directory snapshots at /home/users/.snapshot/homeusers2.<id>/<username>.\n",
      "- /gws/smf/<...>/.snapshot retains hourly/daily snapshots.\n",
      "- Other GWS volumes are not backed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance and best practice\n",
      "- Avoid >100k files in a single directory.\n",
      "- Use \\ls to bypass aliases when listing huge directories; be cautious with colored ls and inter-volume symlinks.\n",
      "- On SOF storage, avoid parallel writes to the same file; use PFS scratch as an intermediary for MPI-IO workflows; consider global write locking if required (performance tradeoff).\n",
      "\n",
      "Training accounts\n",
      "- Temporary, event-limited accounts with predefined services; event organisers request in advance; attendees receive credentials (via OneDrive), set up their local environment before the event, and may need to set portal/notebook passwords via password reset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips for new users\n",
      "- Sci usage guidelines: pick a less-busy sci, avoid heavy/long jobs; use LOTUS for heavy workloads; do not use /tmp or sci for data transfer; avoid hogging IDL dev licenses.\n",
      "- LOTUS guidelines: use runtime IDL only; clean up /tmp; don’t leave data in scratch.\n",
      "- Xfer guidelines: limit parallel rsync/scp processes; use Globus/hpxfer for heavy transfers.\n",
      "- Reporting issues: provide precise path, host, timestamp, and details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Login/how-to\n",
      "- Load your private key locally and connect with ssh -A <user>@login-0X.jasmin.ac.uk, then hop to sci servers; for GUI use NX. X-forwarding only within JASMIN.\n",
      "\n",
      "JASMIN status\n",
      "- CEDA Status page (incidents/maintenance), JASMIN metrics dashboard (GWS, LOTUS, Power, Tape), JASMIN-USERS email list, CEDA News, @cedanews on X.\n",
      "\n",
      "Managing many Unix groups\n",
      "- NFS limits groups in access checks; use newgrp (interactive) or withgroups (non-interactive, via module load jasmin-sci) to run commands under selected groups; use withgroups in scripts/LOTUS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Windows client: MobaXterm\n",
      "- How to install, enable MobAgent to store key, and log in. Alternative: use ssh-agent inside MobaXterm terminal session.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projects/resources (consortium managers)\n",
      "- Use JASMIN Projects Portal to review project records and their requested services/resources.\n",

      "Summary — key information (internal)\n",
      "- Purpose/Scope\n",
      "  - This is the JASMIN user documentation covering: accounts, access, storage, transfers, interactive & batch compute, services (Group Workspaces, Object Store, XFC, Elastic Tape (ET), JDMA, JDMA deprecation → NLDS, Dask Gateway, Pangeo, Notebooks, Globus, GridFTP, rclone, bbcp, rsync/scp/sftp, MobaXterm, NoMachine NX, VSCode remote), Cluster-as-a-Service (Kubernetes, Slurm, NFS), and admin/manager workflows (consortium/GWS managers, project portals).\n",
      "  - Mixes user-level how-to, service descriptions, admin procedures, and system operation notes. Many legacy / deprecated items are present.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Accounts & authentication\n",
      "  - Account types: STANDARD (individual; training accounts short-term), SHARED (multiple responsible users with their own SSH keys; shared password allowed but must be shared securely), SERVICE (for daemons/functions; no SSH key; cannot reset password).\n",
      "  - JASMIN Accounts Portal is central (create account, upload public key, apply for roles).\n",
      "  - SSH public-key authentication is mandatory; private keys must be passphrase-protected and not shared.\n",
      "  - Agent/forwarding recommended (ssh -A); instructions for ssh-keygen, ssh-agent, ssh-add, and platform-specific guidance (Mac, Linux, Windows via OpenSSH or MobaXterm).\n",
      "  - Linking CEDA account to JASMIN accounts portal for Archive access (openID/consent).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Services & access roles\n",
      "  - jasmin-login: required to access login, sci, xfer, LOTUS.\n",
      "  - hpxfer role (legacy) — used to be required for high-performance transfer servers and gridftp; doc contains deprecation notices (role may be no longer required).\n",
      "  - dask, orchid, etc. — separate access roles exist for some services.\n",
      "  - Projects and consortium managers manage resource requests via JASMIN Projects Portal.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Storage overview\n",
      "  - Four main storage types (Phase 4):\n",
      "    - SSD: /home/users and /work/scratch-nopw (good for small files; home backed up; default 100 GB quota).\n",
      "    - PFS (parallel) — e.g. /gws/pw/j07, /work/scratch-pw[2,3] (good for parallel IO).\n",
      "    - SOF (scale-out filesystem) — /gws/nopw/j04 (good for large volumes, not for lots of small files nor parallel writes).\n",
      "    - HPOS (object storage / S3-compatible) — JASMIN Object Store (tenancies, keys, bucket policies).\n",
      "  - Home default quota: 100 GB; home snapshots retained ~1-2 weeks.\n",
      "  - Group Workspaces (GWS): shared project storage, not backed up by default (managers can use Elastic Tape or JDMA to make secondary copies). GWS volumes live under /gws/pw, /gws/nopw, /gws/smf.\n",
      "  - Transfer Cache (XFC): temporary user area with hard (HQ, TB) and temporal quotas (TQ, TB-days); files auto-deleted if quota exceeded or >365 days.\n",
      "  - Advice: avoid >100k files in a single directory; avoid inter-volume symlinks from home; avoid writing many small files on SOF; use scratch for intermediates; use /tmp on node-local only for small local data.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Backups / near-line\n",
      "  - Home snapshots: daily, kept 1–2 weeks.\n",
      "  - smf SSD volumes have snapshots (hourly 10 hours, daily 2 weeks).\n",
      "  - Elastic Tape (ET): for GWS managers to create secondary copies; et_put, et_get, et_ls, et_rm CLI tools; important to NOT remove source files until status is CACHED_SYNCED or SYNCED.\n",
      "  - JDMA: an API-based migration app; being superseded by NLDS (note: JDMA docs referenced).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Data transfer tools & recommendations\n",
      "  - Recommended: Globus (new JASMIN Default Collection, ID/link via JASMIN Accounts Portal; CLI, SDK, web).\n",
      "  - Alternatives:\n",
      "    - GridFTP (legacy; ssh-based or certificate-based gridftp via globus-url-copy is being phased out; doc contains legacy instructions and warnings).\n",
      "    - bbcp, lftp, rsync/scp/sftp for smaller or specific use-cases.\n",
      "    - rclone (allowed subset of commands; mount/rcd/serve disallowed).\n",
      "  - Transfer servers:\n",
      "    - xfer-vm-0[1-3] (virtual) — general transfer & cron on xfer-vm-03 (use crontamer).\n",
      "    - hpxfer[3,4] — physical high-performance DTNs (hpxfer role deprecated for new servers).\n",
      "    - gridftp1 / gridftp2 legacy servers.\n",
      "  - Advice: use transfer servers, not sci/login for bulk transfers; do not open excessive concurrent connections; prefer Globus for reliability and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Compute infrastructure\n",
      "  - Interactive: login servers (login-01..04), NX graphical servers (nx1..nx4), sci virtual/physical (sci-vm-01..06, sci-ph-01/02).\n",
      "  - Batch: LOTUS cluster (Slurm) - queues: test, short-serial, long-serial, par-single, par-multi, high-mem; job submission and monitoring explained; job arrays, mpirun usage, MPI modules.\n",
      "  - ORCHID GPU cluster (NVIDIA A100s) — Orchid partition, separate access role (orchid).\n",
      "  - Cluster-as-a-Service (CaaS) in cloud: Kubernetes, Slurm, Pangeo, Identity Manager, NFS shared storage; note many bits about being able to provision tenancies, VMs, cluster templates, and user/group management (FreeIPA + Keycloak).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Notebook / interactive data science\n",
      "  - JASMIN Notebook Service (JupyterHub/JupyterLab): authentication via JASMIN account; default Jaspy Python environment; users can create their own virtualenvs/conda envs and register kernels; Dask Gateway available (provision Dask clusters onto LOTUS); Pangeo on Kubernetes for multi-user scalable Jupyter.\n",
      "  - Guidance on creating environments in Notebook service and using them as kernels (pip, conda, ipykernel).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Developer tooling & remote editors\n",
      "  - Guidance for MobaXterm (Windows), VSCode Remote-SSH, NoMachine NX graphical desktop; instructions for sending keys, agent forwarding, and handling key format issues.\n",
      "  - jasmin-sci modules and Jaspy environments for Python/R; NAG, IDL information and licensing notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Governance, admin & roles\n",
      "  - Resource requests via Projects Portal; consortium managers approve requests and submit for provisioning; GWS managers responsibilities (space management, approvals).\n",
      "  - Alerts: GWS Scanner, GWS Alert System, dashboards (mon.jasmin.ac.uk), emails.\n",
      "  - Deprecations and migration notes: many deprecation notes scattered (GridFTP, hpxfer role, older CentOS→Rocky9 migration; JDMA → NLDS).\n",
      "\n",
      "Major inconsistencies, errors, and issues to fix (grouped)\n",
      "1) Outdated/deprecated content and conflicting statements\n",
      "  - Many deprecation notes interspersed with older instructions. Examples:\n",
      "    - hpxfer role: several places say hpxfer role required for some transfer servers; others say deprecated/no longer needed. Clarify current policy.\n",
      "    - GridFTP / globus-url-copy: doc still includes legacy gridftp instructions while recommending Globus as primary; needs a single canonical “legacy” section and a clear migration plan.\n",
      "    - JDMA vs NLDS: doc references JDMA extensively but also states NLDS will replace it; clarify status, timelines, and user migration steps.\n",
      "    - IDL licensing and Rocky9 migration: several places marked “not yet ready” or licensing unresolved — centralize and update once final.\n",
      "  - Action: create “Current status / What to use now” summary at top of each major topic and archive older methods into a clearly labeled “Legacy / Deprecated” appendix.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Broken templates, formatting and stray shortcodes\n",
      "  - Many unrendered Hugo/shortcode tokens such as: {{<command>}} open/close mismatches, \"{{</command>}}\" present in outputs, \"{{<link ... >}}\", \"{{<image ...>}}\" etc. These make the doc hard to render and may leak template syntax into the published page.\n",
      "  - Example stray tokens: \"{{</command>}}\" appears multiple times in sections where commands end; several places show raw shortcodes like {{<alert>}} open/close mismatches.\n",
      "  - Action: run the content through the site renderer or linter, remove unmatched tags, ensure code blocks are consistent and include exact shells and outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Typographical, grammatical and copy errors (representative)\n",
      "  - Misspellings: \"re-organise\" (fine UK), \"onwaards\" / \"onwaards\" (typo), \"permisisons\", \"tine\" (time), \"permisison\", \"convering\", \"joeblogs vs joebloggs\" (username inconsistency in examples).\n",
      "  - Duplicate headings: there are many repeated \"Introduction\", \"Overview\" sections — confusing structure.\n",
      "  - Action: run a thorough spell/grammar pass; unify US/UK conventions; reduce duplicate headings.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Consistency & clarity issues (important for security/operations)\n",
      "  - Confusing advice on private key copying: one section says “copy private key to new machines if you need to login from multiple machines” — this is a security risk. Elsewhere doc states private keys must not be shared. These contradict.\n",
      "    - Fix: strongly recommend generating per-machine keys and add public keys to account, or use agent forwarding / ssh-agent with forwarding; advise against copying private keys except under controlled secure conditions with policy/justification.\n",
      "  - Use of OneDrive for training account credential distribution: instructions refer to OneDrive email and password reset; consider security and provide alternate secure ways, or at least emphasize verifying sender and using temporary passwords.\n",
      "  - Confusing use of “password” vs “passphrase”: many sections conflate account password (for portal) and SSH key passphrase. Add a clear glossary and emphasize distinctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Structural problems and duplicated content\n",
      "  - Sections are long and sometimes repeated (e.g., GridFTP over SSH appears multiple times, several similar \"get started\" flows repeated). This makes it hard to find canonical instructions.\n",
      "  - Action: reorganize into a top-level map and single canonical article for each major topic (accounts, storage, transfers, compute, notebooks). Create shorter quickstart checklists with links to detailed pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Technical inaccuracies / missing clarifications\n",
      "  - Default home quota: doc says 100 GB and \"Although you can't directly check usage against your quota\" but then shows pdu -sh. Clarify: pdu reports size but not quota; to check quota use portal or contact support.\n",
      "  - \"You are only allowed to exceed the 100 GB quota for a very brief period\" — needs explicit policy: define thresholds / grace periods and consequences.\n",
      "  - Confusing advice about /tmp across nodes: clarify differences between local node /tmp (NOT shared) and /work scratch (shared) and where it is mounted.\n",
      "  - X11 forwarding: the doc has contradictory statements about -X vs -Y; clarify security/performance and recommend NoMachine NX for GUI to local machines.\n",
      "  - Globus authentication: make explicit that JASMIN Default Collection requires linking JASMIN account to Globus identity; steps scattered — centralize with clear CLI examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Examples and commands with typos or inconsistent examples\n",
      "  - Example UID home snapshots use inconsistent usernames \"joebloggs/joeblogs/joebloggs\" — unify.\n",
      "  - Some code blocks show mismatched fences and outputs; ensure each code snippet includes correct prompt and clear instruction.\n",
      "  - Some HTML-like fragments and stray placeholders remain (e.g., \"MISSING LINK\" or \"see XXX\").\n",
      "\n",
      "8) UX/readability issues\n",
      "  - Long pages with many nested subtopics; users will be overwhelmed.\n",
      "  - Action: create a condensed “cheat-sheet” quickstart per persona (new user, transfer power user, GWS manager, consortium manager, admin) and reference the deep pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concrete suggested corrections & improvements\n",
      "A. Organizational / content-level (high priority)\n",
      "  1. Create a canonical overview page with quickstarts:\n",
      "     - New user quickstart (create portal account → SSH keygen → add public key → apply for jasmin-login → login → try simple commands)\n",
      "     - Transfer quickstart (use Globus recommended; example transfer)\n",
      "     - Compute quickstart (submit a small Slurm job example)\n",
      "     - Notebook quickstart (open notebook, create venv kernel)\n",
      "  2. Reorganize content into separate top-level sections and remove duplication:\n",
      "     - Accounts & authentication\n",
      "     - Storage & snapshot/backups (home, GWS, scratch, XFC, tape/ET, object store)\n",
      "     - Data transfer (Globus first, then other tools as alternatives; clearly label legacy GridFTP instructions)\n",
      "     - Compute (login, sci, LOTUS, GPU/ORCHID)\n",
      "     - Interactive services (Notebooks, Dask Gateway, Pangeo)\n",
      "     - Developer tools (MobaXterm, NX, VSCode Remote)\n",
      "     - Admin & project management (GWS management, projects portal, consortia, CaaS)\n",
      "  3. Move deprecated/legacy procedures into a \"Legacy\" appendix and mark with date + plan for decommission.\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Security and policy (high priority)\n",
      "  1. Decide and state a single policy on private keys: do NOT copy private keys to other machines. If multiple machines require authentication, generate distinct key pairs per machine and upload each public key to the portal or use agent forwarding. Remove any content that suggests copying private key files as a general practice.\n",
      "  2. Clarify passphrase vs password everywhere (boxed note near the top).\n",
      "  3. Consolidate password reset / training-account flow with secure transfer methods (avoid OneDrive if possible; at minimum emphasize code only in encrypted channels).\n",
      "\n",
      "C. Technical fixes (high priority)\n",
      "  1. Fix template shortcodes and unmatched \"{{<command>}} / {{</command>}}\" tags; ensure code blocks render properly.\n",
      "  2. Fix typos and sample usernames (e.g., joebloggs consistently).\n",
      "  3. Correct inconsistent statements about what’s required (e.g., hpxfer) — produce a short “As of <date>” status line at top of related pages stating current truth.\n",
      "  4. Make Globus the canonical recommended method for transfers — add a brief step-by-step CLI example and a short example of automation using globus task wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "D. Documentation clarity & UX (medium priority)\n",
      "  1. Add a small glossary (SSH, key, passphrase, GWS, SOF, PFS, HPOS, XFC, ET, JDMA, NLDS, DTN).\n",
      "  2. Provide a short troubleshooting table for common login issues (agent not forwarded, permission denied, host key verification failed), with the minimal steps to resolve each one.\n",
      "  3. Provide small diagrams and a short “Where to put data?” decision tree (home / gws / scratch / xfc / tape / object).\n",
      "  4. Provide a single unified “Storage types” table (SSD, PFS, SOF, HPOS) with clear examples of what to use for: small files, parallel writes, backups, sharing externally, and whether backed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "E. Editing & copy (medium priority)\n",
      "  1. Run a full spell-check and grammar pass.\n",
      "  2. Ensure consistent use of code formatting and inline command prompts (user@host$...) and remove long verbose examples repeated multiple times.\n",
      "  3. Standardize the way warnings and deprecations are displayed; avoid scattering them throughout — use a consistent banner style and a “What changed” or “Why this matters” note.\n",
      "\n",
      "F. Admin & process (medium priority)\n",
      "  1. Add dates to all “Updated” and “Deprecated” notices.\n",
      "  2. Provide contact/SLAs for helpdesk responses (e.g., expected response times per issue priority).\n",
      "  3. Provide a short “how to request” template for common admin actions (GWS change, training accounts, hpxfer access, object-store tenancy, etc.) to reduce back-and-forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of specific textual corrections (illustrative)\n",
      "- Replace \"The accounts portal profile for the shared account will display, but not allow editing of, the public keys of the responsible users.\" → clarify: \"The portal displays the responsible users' public keys for the shared account but does not allow editing of those keys in the shared-account view; each responsible user must update their own key in their standard account profile.\"\n",
      "- Fix the repeated “Step 4” under “Get a login account” where two steps are numbered Step 4.\n",
      "- Remove stray \"nan\" heading near login example.\n",
      "- Fix code example usernames \"joeblogs\" vs \"joebloggs\" to single consistent example (e.g., joebloggs).\n",
      "- Fix misspelling \"onwaards\" → \"onwards\".\n",
      "- Fix `scp` example with `mailto:mailto:support@jasmin.ac.uk` malformed link.\n",
      "\n",
      "Priority plan (recommended)\n",
      "1. Immediate (within 1–2 weeks)\n",
      "   - Fix rendering issues: unmatched shortcodes, broken command blocks.\n",
      "   - Add a brief “This doc covers X; for current recommended methods see: (Globus, Jaspy, Notebooks, LOTUS)” at top; flag deprecated sections.\n",
      "   - Fix security contradictions about private keys and add glossary entry for passphrase vs password.\n",
      "   - Consolidate Globus as the recommended transfer method and mark GridFTP as legacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Short-term (1–2 months)\n",
      "   - Reorganize content into canonical sections, remove duplication.\n",
      "   - Correct typos and unify example usernames.\n",
      "   - Produce a “Quickstart for new users” page + “Troubleshooting cheat-sheet”.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Medium-term (2–6 months)\n",
      "   - Review and update all content affected by the Rocky 9 migration (IDL, GridFTP, services, Nemo).\n",
      "   - Update CaaS/cluster docs once Kubernetes/Slurm images and policies finalized.\n",
      "   - Implement better automated testing/linting (link-checker, shortcode validation).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want I can:\n",
      "- produce a short \"new user quickstart\" page from the doc,\n",
      "- or generate a prioritized list of pages to refactor first,\n",
      "- or run an automated pass to extract all shortcodes / template tokens and list errors to fix.\n",
